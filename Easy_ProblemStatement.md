 Input
 There is an unknown number of tests (less than 100). Each test consists of an integer N and a string s of length lower than 1001. 
 s contains only small and large latin letters.
 
 Output
 Your task is to print string s replacing normal letters with the ones above. If n=2 you should reverse the order of the letters 
 and for n=0 the program should end. Furthermore, the distance between the letters is 1 space and between words is 3 spaces.
